Prerequisites:

- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) installed globally

To develop locally:

```
npm install
vc dev
```

```
open http://localhost:3000
```

To build locally:

```
npm install
vc build
```

To deploy:

```
npm install
vc deploy
```

To reduce concurrent webhook deliveries (which can cause `LOCK_FAILED` logs), set Telegram webhook with a single connection:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/telegram",
    "secret_token": "your-secret-token",
    "max_connections": 1
  }'
```
